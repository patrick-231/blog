                <p>Almost every one of us on the planet has a favorite sport that we play or follow. So finding the Best Sports Blogs is no small feat! But I guarantee, you will be stoked with this really cool selection of sporting blogs. Whether you’re into NFL, NFA, MBL, kayaking, cricket, baseball, gymnastics, badminton, rock climbing, or chess, there is going to be a Sports Blog (or five) that you will become addicted to! The sporting culture runs deep, and sports played at school and college level are totally geared for producing future star athletes across the board. Despite some lengthy and extreme surfing and googling sessions, I still can’t define the different sports blog niches completely. It’s a vast and seemingly endless array of non-stop action. One thing I did decide, in my quest to find the creme de la creme, was to leave out sporting blogs that involved betting. I reckon those blogs would fall under gaming. What do you guys think? </p> <br><br>

                        <h2><strong>Sports Blog Niches</strong></h2>
                        <p>Here’s a sample of typical sports blog niches:</p>
                        <li>Action Sports Blogs (also called Adventure or Extreme Sports)</li>

                        <p>This is by no means a complete list of possible categories, but it’ll pretty much cover the main sports (and top blogs) that I want to showcase today.

                            As with all blogging genres, the many blogging niches within the Sports category are an open invitation to create your own sports blog. Anyone that loves writing about sports could start a Sports Blog. And as you’ll see from Our Top 38 Sports Blog selection, many companies that sell sports gear include amazing blogs that keep you all updated on the latest results, games, matches, news, and other sporting events.
                            
                            Competitive sports will usually have an “official” sports blog. These are usually the most informative. But variety is the spice of life. There are also 1000s of sports blogs dedicated to amateur sports and people who enjoy taking part in different sports just for the social and fitness aspects.
                            
                            So let’s jump straight in!</p>
